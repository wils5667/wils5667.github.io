<p> Dawson Knox is an American football player that inspires me. He currently plays for the buffalo bills as there tight end.</p>
<p> He is an amazing person on and off the field. On the field is a leader and after watching a lot of the bills game, you can notice it</p>
<p> He carries himself with dignity. Off the field he will vist local buffalo schools and has a charity rasing money for pediatric cancer</p>
