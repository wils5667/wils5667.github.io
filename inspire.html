        <p>Tyler Bass is an NFL kicker who plays for the Buffalo Bills, having been drafted in 2020. As a kicker in the NFL, people often ridicule kickers because they are usually the last resort at the end of the game. Despite not being a glorified position, Tyler Bass inspires others with his sportsmanship on the field and his community work. On the field, he is respectful to the opposing team and supportive of his teammates, showing great care for his organization. His resilience is evident, as seen after a tough loss against the Kansas City Chiefs. Off the field, he partners with the Ten Lives Club, a New York cat shelter. This organization rescues, provides medical treatment, and helps in rehoming and fostering cats.</p>
