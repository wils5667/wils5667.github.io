        <p>Tyler Bass is a NFL kicker that plays for the Buffalo Bills, he was drafted to the Buffalo Bills team in 2020. As a kicker in the NFL people often ridicule the kickers of teams because normally at the end of the game, the kicker is the last resort. Being a kicker is not a glory postion in the National Football League. The reason that Tyler Bass inspires others because of his sportsmanship on the field along with the community work that he does. On the field he does his job but with respect to the other team, he is also very supportive of his teammates and cares a great deal about the people in his organization. After a tough loss againist the Kansas City Chiefs, he was still standing with his team. Off the field he parnters with the Ten Lives Club, which is a cat shelter in New York. This organization rescues cats from the streest of New York and provide medical treatment as well as rehoming and fostering cats. </p>
