<p> Dawson Knox is an American football player that inspires me. He currently plays for the buffalo bills as there tight end.</p>
<p> He is an amazing person on and off the field. On the field is a leader and after watching a lot of the bills game, you can notice it. </p>
<p> He carries himself with dignity. Off the field he will visit local buffalo schools and has a charity raising money for pediatric cancer.</p>
<p> Even after the loss of his brother, he still remain to be a good person on and off the field and gives his time and money to others. </p>
<p> He influences me to remember to never let life get you down and that you can always do something to help or support other people.</p>
<p> Dawson Knox also reminds me that the people we see on TV are just that, people, and we should always treat them with love and respect</p>
